   git clone https://github.com/SuryaGoud34/easyswitch-google.git
   ```

2. **Open Chrome Extensions**:

##  How to Use

### Setting Up Your Accounts

1. **Click the EasySwitch icon** in your Chrome toolbar
2. **Click "Add Account"** to register your first account
3. **Enter a nickname** when prompted "Account nickname for 1st account" (e.g., "Work Gmail", "Personal YouTube")
4. Your account will appear as **#01 Work Gmail** in the list
5. **Repeat** for all your Google accounts - each new account gets the next number (#02, #03, etc.)

### Switching Accounts

1. **Visit any Google service** (Gmail, YouTube, Drive, etc.)
2. **Click the EasySwitch icon**
3. **Click "Switch"** next to the account you want to use
4. **Done!** You'll be switched to that account instantly

### Managing Accounts

- **Add accounts**: Click the "Add Account" button and enter a nickname
- **Account numbering**: Your first account becomes #01, second becomes #02, and so on
- **Remove accounts**: Click "Remove Mode" then delete unwanted accounts
- **Organized display**: Each account shows with its number badge and custom nickname
- **Edit nicknames**: Delete and re-add with a new nickname (keeps the same number position)

## üîß How It Works

EasySwitch uses Google's native account switching mechanism:
- **URL Parameters**: Adds `?authuser=N` to Google URLs
- **Path Modification**: Uses `/u/N/` paths for supported services
- **Smart Detection**: Automatically detects the best switching method

**No passwords or sensitive data are stored** - we only save the nicknames you create!

##  Supported Sites

-  **Gmail** (gmail.com)
-  **Google Drive** (drive.google.com)

##  FAQ

**Q: Is my data safe?**
A: Yes! EasySwitch only stores account nicknames locally. No passwords, emails, or personal data are collected.

**Q: Why doesn't it work on some sites?**
A: EasySwitch only works on Google-owned websites. It won't work on third-party sites.

**Q: Can I sync my accounts across devices?**
A: Currently, accounts are stored locally per browser. Cross-device sync may be added in future versions.

**Q: How are accounts organized?**
A: Each account gets a unique number badge starting from #01. When you add "Work Gmail" as your first account, it appears as "#01 Work Gmail" in the list.

**Q: What happens to numbering when I delete an account?**
A: The numbers update automatically. If you delete #02, then #03 becomes the new #02 to keep the sequence clean.

**Q: Can I change the order of my accounts?**
A: Currently, accounts are ordered by the sequence you added them. To reorder, you'd need to delete and re-add accounts in your preferred sequence.

**Q: The extension stopped working after a Chrome update**
A: Try reloading the extension or reinstalling it. Report persistent issues on GitHub.
